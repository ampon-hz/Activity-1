    <h2>What is Lock Picking?</h2>
    <p>
      Lock picking is the practice of unlocking a key may it be for
      locksmithing, essential skill or a criminal intent. Some others try to
      learn it as well as a hobby. Lock picking is the practice of unlocking a
      lock by manipulating the components of the lock device without the
      original key. It can be done with many tools, and as a matter of fact ANY
      tools can be of use when committing it. As for this short-tutorial, we will
      be using a paperclip—an item that we can find almost anywhere.

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Bend the paperclip as demonstrated below.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Keep bending (until maging air bender) this time bend 90-degrees
      upward—again, the smaller the better. Continue to make two more small
      90-degree bends alternating in direction. After your last bend, you should
      have something like seen below!

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      The perfect time to find a lock, now that we have our tools, it's time to
      finally get picking. short end of your paperclip tension wrench into the
      bottom of the keyway as shown below.
      <p>Next, apply a very VERY light amount of force on the tension wrench in the direction you would naturally turn the key.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      The perfect time to find a lock, now that we have our tools, it's time to
      finally get picking. short end of your paperclip tension wrench into the
      bottom of the keyway as shown below.
      <p>While maintaining light tension throughout this entire step, insert your paperclip lock pick into the keyway with the two bumps facing the pins.

        Push your lock pick all the way into the lock until you feel it hit the rear of the keyway.

        Next, press your lock pick against the pins until you can feel them slightly lifting. At this point begin scrubbing the pins back and forth—similar to brushing your teeth..</p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>While raking you feel the plug rotate significantly in the direction you are tensioning. Apply heavier tension and continue to rotate the keyway until the lock fully disengages!

      Congratulations, you have just picked your first lock!</p>
